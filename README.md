# NoteTakingApp

This exercise is optional. It's intended for students who doesn't want to re-build any of the previous exercises with the new [production workflow](https://github.com/ReactForBeginners/es6-production-workflow), but rather get a completely new exercise together with the new workflow.  

The app you'll create is a basic note taking app, with the features described below.

We do not have any other demands than the features listed below. Other than that, it's up to you to decide how you want the app to work.

## Features

* Creating a new note
* Edit existing notes (either live saving or a 'save' button)
* Deleting notes  

Good luck!
